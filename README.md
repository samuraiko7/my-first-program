# my-first-program
Uploading my first program to GitHub

TASK GIVEN: Create a program that asks the user for their age, favorite color, and number of hours they study each day. Then, based on their input, the program should:

Check if the user is a teenager (ages 13â€“19).
Check if the favorite color is "blue" (if not, suggest it might be a good color to like).
Check if they study at least 2 hours a day and give them a message based on their study time.

I know I've strayed from the path and overcomplicated such a simple program, but it was just out of curiosity.
